## üîç How It Works

1. **Text Processing**: Input text is cleaned and preprocessed
2. **Content Analysis**: Key concepts and topics are identified
3. **Question Generation**: AI models create relevant MCQs
4. **Answer Validation**: Generated options are verified for accuracy
5. **Formatting**: Questions are formatted for display

## üìä Examples

### Input Text

```
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.
This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells and requires sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.
```

### Generated MCQ

**Question**: What is the primary function of photosynthesis?

- A) To produce oxygen for animals
- B) To convert light energy into chemical energy ‚úì
- C) To absorb carbon dioxide from air
- D) To create water in plants
