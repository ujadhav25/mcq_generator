## 🛠️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable          | Description                         | Required         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`  | OpenAI API key for GPT models       | Yes              |
| `MAX_QUESTIONS`   | Maximum number of questions allowed | No (default: 50) |
| `DEFAULT_SUBJECT` | Default subject for MCQs            | No               |

### Model Configuration

The application supports multiple language models:

- OpenAI GPT-3.5/GPT-4
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Local models (optional)

Update the model configuration in `config.py`:

```python
MODEL_CONFIG = {
    "provider": "openai",  # or "huggingface", "local"
    "model_name": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "max_tokens": 2000
}
```

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Text Processing**: Input text is cleaned and preprocessed
2. **Content Analysis**: Key concepts and topics are identified
3. **Question Generation**: AI models create relevant MCQs
4. **Answer Validation**: Generated options are verified for accuracy
5. **Formatting**: Questions are formatted for display/export

## 📊 Examples

### Input Text

```
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.
This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells and requires sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.
```

### Generated MCQ

**Question**: What is the primary function of photosynthesis?

- A) To produce oxygen for animals
- B) To convert light energy into chemical energy ✓
- C) To absorb carbon dioxide from air
- D) To create water in plants
